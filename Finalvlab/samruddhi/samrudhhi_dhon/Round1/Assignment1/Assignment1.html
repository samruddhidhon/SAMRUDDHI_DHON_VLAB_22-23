    </header>
    <br>
    1. To provide remote-access to simulation-based Labs in various disciplines of Science and Engineering.
    </p><br>
    <P>2. To enthuse students to conduct experiments by arousing their curiosity. This would help them in learning basic and advanced concepts through remote experimentation.
    </P><br>
    3. To provide a complete Learning Management System around the Virtual Labs where the students/ teachers can avail the various tools for learning, including additional web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self-evaluation.

        <h1>JK Flip-Flop</h1>
        <h2>NAND and NOR Latches</h2>
        <h3>NOR Latch</h3>
        <img src="logo.PNG"><br>
        <p>2-d vectors It can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates. The stored bit is present on the output marked Q. While the S and R inputs are both low, feedback maintains the Q and Q outputs in a constant state, with Q the complement of Q. If S (Set) is pulsed high while R (Reset) is held low, then the Q output is forced high, and stays high when S returns to low; similarly, if R is pulsed high while S is held low, then the Q output is forced low, and stays low when R returns to low.</p>
        <h4>NAND Latch </h4>
        <img src="logo1.PNG"><BR>
        <P>This is an alternate model of the simple SR latch built with NAND logic gates. Set and reset now become active low signals, denoted S and R respectively. Otherwise, operation is identical to that of the SR latch. Historically, SR-latches have been predominant despite the notational inconvenience of active-low inputs </P>
        <h5>JK Flip Flop</h5>
        <img src="logo3.GIF"><BR>
        <P>JK flip flop is mostly implemented as Master Slave flip flop. The information present at at J and K inputs is transmitted to master flip-flop on positive edge of a clock pulse and held there until negative pulse occurs, after which it is allowed to pass through the slave flip-flop.</P>
        <H6>JK Timing Digram</h6>
        <P>The following Digram depicts the change of JK flip flop Output with time pulse. It is negativve edge triggered.</P>
